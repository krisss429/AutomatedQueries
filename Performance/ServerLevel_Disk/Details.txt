This can be used to test IO subsystem on Unity

We should test at minimum:
                Sequential read IO (simulate backups and large reports)
                Random read/write IO (probably test both write heavy and then read heavy, maybe 70-80% each way)
                Different queue depth settings (i.e. 16,32)
                Block sizes of SQL extents (64KB), SQL Page (8KB) and DELL suggestion of 512KB (best practices doc lists some tests to run)
                Multiple threads, probably along the lines of ½ # of cores and/or MAXDOP value 

Plus whatever else you guys think necessary for each, above is minimum we should hit, since this is scriptable it can all be pre-staged and ready to go





This is the command you can run.  Just create a folder under C:\Temp called diskspd or something like that and copy the .exe and .xsd to that location. 

I’ll upload this this also to install location

diskspd -c7G -d90 -r -w40 -t8 -o8 -b64K -h -L c:\test.dat > e:\DISKSPD_C.txt

-c = size of test file
-d = runtime of workload (seconds)
-r = random IO
-w = percent of write activity
-t = threads
-o = outstanding IO (queue depth)
-b = block size
-h = disable hardware caching
-L = measure latency
C:\test.dat = name\location of test file
