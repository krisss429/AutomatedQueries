Step-

Open a PowerShell terminal and type in

$profile

This should display the path that would be used to store you profile. However it might not be created yet, so in order to find out, type the following:

test-path $profile

If the result is true, you’re all set, else type the following to create the profile:

new-item -path $profile -itemtype file -force

You’re now all set with your profile, and can customize it, by launching the PowerShell ISE:

powershell_ise $profile

Auto-load scripts on PowerShell startup
In the ps1 file of your profile, usually named “Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1”, you can enter the following code, so that the folder of your choice will contain scripts that will be executed on startup:


# directory where my scripts are stored

$psdir="D:\Documents\Powershell\Scripts\autoload"  

# load all 'autoload' scripts

Get-ChildItem "${psdir}\*.ps1" | %{.$_} 

Write-Host "Custom PowerShell Environment Loaded"
